# NetGuard

# What is NetGuard?
NetGuard is my new C# packet filter base for `legend 1(ECSRO, jSRO)` Silkroad Online files, it will most likely work for vSRO 1.88 aswell!

### You may remember me or my previous projects, such as Supermike, Superman, and KRYLFILTER.
[Superman](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/sro-pserver-guides-releases/3778943-release-superman-vsro-anti-exploit-free.html)
[Supermike](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/sro-pserver-guides-releases/3943130-release-supermike-exploit-filter-free-tons-features-stable.html)

The original engine, async server, and base were initially created by Chernobyl but have been rewritten multiple times since then.

# Why NetGuard?
I wanted to create a packet filter with a clean and structured approach to handling packets from both the server and the client. This version achieves that goal. However, it’s not the final release — the project has been successfully ported to `.NET 8.0` and now support both Windows and Linux

Why `.NET 8.0`? it bring significant improvements, including better socket handling and optimized performance.
